# EFOLIO Task 1 â€“ Vue.js Project

This project was created for EFOLIO Task 1, demonstrating the setup and modification of a basic Vue.js application using Visual Studio Code.

## Task 1.1 â€“ Vue.js Setup

I began by installing Visual Studio Code, Node.js, and the Vue CLI. Using the CLI, I created a basic Vue.js app with the following commands:

```bash
vue create my-vue-app
cd my-vue-app
npm run serve
```

Once the app was running successfully on `http://localhost:5174`.

## Task 1.2 â€“ Custom Component & GitHub

To extend the project, I created a new component called `MyName.vue`, which displays my name on the welcome page.
