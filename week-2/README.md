## ✅ Activity 2.1: Get Authors Born After 1850

### 🎯 Goal:

Create a reactive list of authors born after the year 1850.

## ✅ Activity 2.2: Get All Famous Works

### 🎯 Goal:

Extract a flattened list of all famous work titles from all authors.

## ✅ Activity 3: Rendering Lists with v-for

The `v-for` directive in Vue.js is used to loop through arrays and display items dynamically. Below are three tasks that utilize this directive for rendering lists based on previously computed data.

## 4: v-if and v-show Directives

### Overview

Vue.js provides two powerful directives for conditional rendering: `v-if` and `v-show`.

- **v-if**: Removes or inserts elements in the DOM based on a condition. If the condition is false, the element is not rendered at all.
- **v-show**: Always renders the element but toggles its visibility using CSS (`display: none` when false).

### Activity 4.1: Toggle the Message Visibility When the Button is Clicked

#### Objective

Create a toggle feature where a button click shows or hides a message using `v-if` and `v-else`.


### Activity 5: To highlight an author

#### Objective

Add styles to highlight an author name
